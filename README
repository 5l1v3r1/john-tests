This is supposed to reside *in* a John the Ripper tree. That is, if you
have this structure for john:

john/
john/src
john/run

...this Test Suite should reside in:

john/test


So when checking out this from GitHub, you would:

cd john
git clone https://github.com/magnumripper/jtrTestSuite.git test
